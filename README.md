# Keylogger Tool

## Overview

The **Keylogger Tool** is a Python-based program designed to log keystrokes made by a user on a computer. It captures all keyboard input, storing the information in a log file. While keyloggers can be used for malicious purposes, this tool is intended for educational, ethical hacking, and monitoring purposes with proper consent. It is ideal for those learning about cybersecurity, forensics, or parental control and monitoring software.

## Features

- **Keystroke Logging**: Captures all keyboard input, including special characters, and logs them for review.
- **Stealth Mode**: Operates silently in the background without alerting the user, making it ideal for monitoring.
- **Timestamped Logs**: Logs include timestamps to record exactly when each keypress occurs.
- **Automatic Log File Creation**: Creates a local file to store logged keystrokes for later analysis.
- **Email Reporting (optional)**: Can be configured to automatically send logs via email at regular intervals for remote monitoring.
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Works on any system that supports Python, making it a versatile tool for monitoring across various environments.
- **Customization Options**: Easily configurable for different logging durations, email intervals, and log file formats.

## Ethical Use Cases

- **Parental Control**: Monitor your child’s online activity to ensure they are safe from inappropriate content or dangerous online interactions.
- **Employee Monitoring**: Ensure employees are adhering to company policies while using corporate devices (with consent).
- **Forensics**: Analyze system activity in forensic investigations, ensuring accurate reconstruction of events based on keyboard input.
- **Personal Use**: Track your own activities for productivity analysis or to recover important information lost during typing.

## How It Works

1. **Keystroke Logging**:
   - The tool intercepts keyboard input in real-time.
   - It records every keystroke, including letters, numbers, and special characters, in a log file.
   
2. **Stealth Operation**:
   - It runs in the background without user notification, ensuring undisturbed monitoring.
   
3. **Log File Management**:
   - The tool creates log files, typically stored locally, which can be accessed later for review.
   - Logs can include optional timestamps to track activity patterns.

4. **Email Reporting (optional)**:
   - When configured, the tool can send log files via email at specified intervals, allowing remote monitoring from anywhere.
   - This is useful for administrators or supervisors who need access to the logs without physically being present.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - `pynput` (for listening to keyboard input)
  - `smtplib` (optional, for sending logs via email)

Install dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ritesh-r99/keylogger.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd keylogger
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Keylogger

To start logging keystrokes, run the following command:

```bash
python keylogger.py
```

The tool will begin capturing all keyboard inputs and will store the data in a log file (by default, `keylogs.txt`).



## Future Enhancements

- **Improved Stealth Features**: Adding advanced features to minimize the detection of the keylogger by antivirus software.
- **Encryption of Logs**: Encrypting logs to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
- **Multiple Input Monitoring**: Extending the tool to capture other input devices like mouse clicks or touchscreen gestures.
- **Remote Access Control**: Implementing features to control the keylogger remotely via a secure interface.
